React component lifecycle methods
****************************************************************
Props .. 
when react sees an element as user defined component, it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object . 
This object is called Props.
<welcome name="sara">
function welcome(props){}
React components should behave as pure with respect to their props .. i.e props can never be updated in the component

State  
This is a local copy of data for a component .. this is not accessible to any parent / child directly unlesss passed as props
Only way to update state is using setState()
React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single for performance
Since this.props and this.state may update async , never rely on their values for creaing next state
ex : this.setState({counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment}) this might give an incorrect values

To address this, we can use a second form of setState that accepts a function
This will receive the previous state as first arg and props at the time of update as second arg
this.setState((state, props) => ({
    counter : state.counter + props.counter
}))

***************************************************************

While Mounting

constructor -- getDerivedStateFromProps -- render -- componentDidMount
// not safe to use componentWillMount .. avoid using this at all

WHile Updating

getDerivedStateFromProps -- shouldComponentUpdate -- render -- getsnapshotbeforeupdate -- componentDidUpdate
// avoid .. componentwillupdate .. componentwillreceiveprops

while unmounting

componentWillUnmount

Controlled vs Uncontrolled Component

Controlled component is one that takes its current value through props and notifies changes through callbacks like onchange.
A paretnt component controls it by handling the callback and managing its own state and passing the new values as props to the 
controlled component. You could as call this as a dumb component.

A Uncontrolled component is one that stores its own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value 
when you need it. This is a bit more like a traditional HTML.

Obj based approach vs array based approach

// example to update record inside an array with array based approach

// Array -based
const streamReducer = (state = [], action) => {
    switch(action.type){
        case EDI_STREAM: 
        return state.map(stream = > {
            if(stream.id === action.payload.id){
                return action.payload;
            }else{
                return stream;
            }
        })
    }
}

// obj based
cons streamReducer = (state = {}, action){
    switch(action.type){
        case EDIT_STREAM:
            const newState = { ...state};//creating a brand new state with all the key value pairs from the earlier state
            newState[action.payload.id] // property accessor notation = action.payload;
            return newState;

            /// the above 3 luines can be rewritten as below using key interpolation symtac
            return {...state, [action.payload.id]: action.payload}
            // in the above we dont know the key earlier, based on what ever the value is make it a key and assign the value
    }
}

// with React-Router, ech component needs to be deisgned to work in isolation(fetch it's own data)
// i.e if a user goes to particular route while loading the page, it might not have the data from the other component as
// the otehr component might not be initialised already


// Since components are rendered by react-router-dom i.e the componewnt is being rendered by route component
// if we log props in our componewnt it will habe the following .. history, location, match thesea re all from react-router-dom


// PUT VS PATCH
// With PUT .... when we make a request with particluar id to the api , then it will take all the diff properties in the db and replace with what we have made request
// this might delete any params that we missed in the request

// With PATCH .. we are going to pass som e properties in the body of request then it will only replace those propertuies


// React portals (Modal windows)
// creating modal windows with react are challenging .. y ???
// When using modal, it will be depply nested in side the dom of react app.
// ie. app root .. provider .. app. component .. modal
// it is hard to maintian the position of modal and z-index.. as if any of the parent's x-index is 0 it won't work
// so we have a cheat in react by creating the modal as child to the body usng Portal

// A portal helps us to render a modal component .. but not as direct child of the component .. but as child of some other elemnt in our html hierarchy


// React Fragments
// Essentially a JSX loking element that is going to return multiple elemetns with out having to put enclosing element/div
